"""
The program checks if a password is strong based on criteria: minimum length of 8 characters, 
at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
It uses a loop to repeatedly ask for a password until a strong one is entered.
The code uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to validate the password against the criteria.
The code is wrapped in a function (password_checker) for neatness and reusability.
